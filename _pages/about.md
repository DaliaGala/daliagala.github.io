I was born in Polish mountains called Sudety, and moved 3 times to different cities by the age of 9. I spent most of my life in Kielce (a city of 200k between Warsaw and Krakow), and I went to secondary school there. In the last year of school, I came up with the idea of studying abroad and applied to the UK. I got a conditional offer to study Molecular and Cellular Biology at Glasgow, University, finished school, wrote my exams, met my condition and got accepted into University, and went to Norway over the summer to do my first ever abroad internship in Oslo University Hospital. After the 1st year in Glasgow, I moved to Australia to complete a year of exchange at Melbourne University. I also did two internships in Australia, one in Monash University, and one in University of Queensland. After I returned to Glasgow, I applied to switch from my BHons to MSci, and, as a part of my new degree, was accepted to work for a year in the Francis Crick Institute in London during my 4th year. Before that, I spent the summer doing an internship in the US, in a company called Neogen in Nebraska. In 2019, I finished my MSci top of the class (I even got a prize!), and I was accepted to do my PhD at Oxford University. I'm working on synaptic plasticity, which means I study how synapses (connections between neurons - nerve cells) form when learning takes place.
