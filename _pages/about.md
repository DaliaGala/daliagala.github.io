**I am a researcher at the University of Oxford who is passionate about data.**

I am naturally curious and passionate about data - particularly where it spans multiple disciplines and allows us to understand the big picture. My background in biological research and expertise in experimental design make me well-prepared to address complex challenges in data analysis, conducting research, and deploying analytical models. During my DPhil in Biochemistry at the University of Oxford, I have expanded my programming skills and developed my knowledge of machine learning. I am thrilled by the immense potential that data holds for shaping our future, and I am eager to contribute to its transformative power.

## Education

**2019 - 2023** DPhil - University of Oxford, [Ilan Davis Lab](https://ilandavis.com/dalia-gala)

I am working on the involvement of glia in synapse development at the neuromuscular junction. I also collaborate with engineers in Micron and in the Department of Engineering to help with microscopy technology development from the point of view of a biologist. I also worked on our lab's [SARS‑CoV‑2 collaboration](https://elifesciences.org/articles/74153).

**2014 - 2019** MSci - University of Glasgow

I completed an Integrated Master's Degree in Molecular and Cellular Biology at the University of Glasgow. I completed the second year of my degree on an abroad exchange to the University of Melbourne.

I did my Master’s project at the Thomas Surrey lab in the Francis Crick Institute in London. I was working on the dynamic remodelling of the microtubule cytoskeleton.
