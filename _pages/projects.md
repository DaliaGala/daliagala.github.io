## Target Variable Definition Simulator
[link](https://target-variable-simulator-hiring.streamlit.app/) _2023_

The objective of algorithmic systems in the hiring process is to anticipate the qualities of a "good" employee. However, defining a "good" employee solely based on algorithms is problematic. This concept is vague, subjective, and can have significant consequences on fairness. To address this issue, I created FairTargetSim in Streamlit. It is an interactive simulator that utilizes real-world data to allow users to define target variables. Its purpose is to educate non-technical individuals involved in the process and enable all stakeholders to comprehend the fairness implications associated with defining target variables.

This is a project completed as part of the [Turing Internship Network](https://www.turing.ac.uk/collaborate-turing/internships) in collaboration with [Accenture Labs](https://www.accenture.com/gb-en/services/about/innovation-hub-the-dock), led by [Professor Milo Phillips-Brown](https://www.milopb.com/).

## Looking for a Handsome Carpenter! Debiasing GPT-3 Job Advertisements
[link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11374) _2022_

Generative language models like GPT-3 have opened up new possibilities for downstream tasks. However, addressing biases in these models is often not tailored to real-world impact. In our study, we use GPT-3 to create unbiased job advertisements. I participated in a project where we compared zero-shot generated ads to real ones and evaluate prompt-engineering and fine-tuning as debiasing methods. We found that prompt-engineering offered no significant improvement in bias or realism, while fine-tuning, especially on unbiased ads, improved realism and reduces bias.

This project was completed as part of [OxAi Labs](https://www.oxai.org/labs) team and resulted in a [publication](https://aclanthology.org/2022.gebnlp-1.22/) where I am a co-first author. The code is available [here](https://github.com/oxai/gpt3-jobadvert-bias).

## PyGame game: FlyNet

I wrote a simple game about catching fruit flies in pygame to learn more about Object Oriented Programming.

## Microarray Analysis Program
[link](https://github.com/DaliaGala/MicroarrayAnalyser) _2019_

This is the first program I ever wrote. In the October 2019 Oxford DTC course titled "Introduction to Programming," students were given a choice of four programming tasks. I selected the task of designing and writing an image analysis program for reading DNA microarray images and generating a CSV file with signal strength values for "red" and "green" wells. I successfully created this program with limited functionality in a week. The program can accurately identify the location of the wells and provide RGB pixel values for the well centers. This programming task followed a 2 week intense course in python.
